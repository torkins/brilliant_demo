
# Demo for an interactive tool for Light Reflection 

Basic flow is:

## Edit mode
Add walls/mirrors/bunnys/phantoms, and a viewer. 

For the things you add, click on them and edit config options on the left.

The "viewer" stands in for a person and has an orientation they are viewing.  Reflections are from their perspective.

"Bunnies" are the targets that we will be looking at in the mirror.

"Phantoms" are for the game mode.  The stage-creator places phantoms to give incorrect options to the user in the game.

## Sandbox mode
User can move / rotate view, and move bunnies. Click Animate Ray to see the light path and the images it forms

## Game mode
Display the Phantoms placed by the stage-creator as well as a phantom in the real mirror image (in this case just the one the viewer sees).  User should click the correct one and get feedback. Click "Show Solution" for an explanation animation.
